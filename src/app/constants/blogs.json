    "title": "Construction Work in Progress (WIP): A Critical Accounting Tool for Successful Project Management",
    "intro": "Construction Work in Progress (WIP) is an essential accounting process that provides a snapshot of the status and associated costs of partially completed jobs. When paired with the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition, WIP reports are crucial for keeping projects on budget and ensuring accurate invoicing.",
    "heading1": "Why WIP Is Vital for Financial Forecasting",
    "paragraph1": "WIP reports go beyond ensuring timely payments. Financial institutions, including banks and creditors, use these reports to assess the profitability of construction companies. They reveal whether contractors are accurately estimating and billing for direct job costs in a way that ensures profitability. This information can significantly impact a company’s ability to secure financing or lines of credit for future projects.",
    "heading2": "What is Construction Work in Progress (WIP)?",
    "paragraph2": "WIP reports detail the monetary value of all work completed but not yet invoiced. These reports, used alongside the percentage-of-completion method, indicate how much has been spent relative to the actual progress of the project. In essence, WIP helps contractors know whether they are overbilling or underbilling, which directly affects a project's profitability.",
    "heading3": "Work in Progress vs. Work in Process",
    "paragraph3": "While 'work in progress' and 'work in process' may seem similar, there’s an important distinction. Work in process typically refers to the production process of manufacturing goods and focuses on optimizing costs within the manufacturing cycle. In construction, however, 'work in progress' is the preferred term as it offers insights into whether a contractor is overbilling or underbilling on any given project.",
    "heading4": "The Purpose of a WIP Report",

      "Percentage of Completion (POC) = Actual Cost / Budget Cost",
      "Multiply the POC by the Contract Value to determine how much of the contract you should invoice based on how much of the budget you've spent.",
      "Subtract any previously Billed Revenue to avoid overbilling."
    ],
    "heading6": "Overbilling vs. Underbilling",
    "paragraph6": "WIP calculations can also reveal whether you're overbilling or underbilling:",
    "benefits6": [
      "Overbilling occurs when you've invoiced for more work than you've completed, which might boost cash flow in the short term but can create financial strain later.",
      "Underbilling means you've completed more work than you've invoiced for, leading to negative cash flow and potential project delays due to insufficient funds for necessary materials."
    ],
    "heading7": "Managing WIP Values: What to Do with Positive or Negative Balances",
    "paragraph7": "Managing WIP values requires tracking for various balances:",
    "benefits7": [
      "A zero WIP balance means you’re perfectly aligned, with work completed and billed equally.",
      "A positive WIP balance indicates you've completed work that hasn't been invoiced, which means it's time to issue an invoice to ensure proper cash flow.",
      "A negative WIP balance means you're overbilling, which might seem like a cash flow boost, but can signal financial risk and require careful management."
    ],
    "conclusion": "WIP reports offer essential insights that help construction businesses maintain accurate cash flow and track profitability. By automating these reports and integrating them into your financial management processes, you can reduce stress, eliminate errors, and ensure a more predictable project outcome."

    "title": "Lien Waiver in Construction industry, Mohammad Mohammad, East Carolina University, USA",
    "heading1": "Abstract",
    "paragraph1": "Choosing to write about lien waiver in construction was because of misunderstanding between my team, myself, and PNC Bank. We went in this research to identify the lien waiver in construction, types, why are lien waivers necessary?, the difference between lien waivers, lien releases, and no lien clauses.",
    "heading3": "Introduction",
    "paragraph3": "A lien waiver is a kind of legal agreement that relinquishes the right of an individual or corporation to put a lien on the properties of another party. In certain cases, mechanics as well as contractors make use of lien exemptions. Once a client has paid in full, a lien waiver may be issued that demonstrates that the contractor has no right to lien the land. In essence, a lien is a bill attached to your house. It means, among other items, that the home cannot be sold or refinanced without paying for the burden.A lien waiver states that the bill has been paid and because of work completed and materials that have been ordered, the contractor no longer has the right to file a lien on the house.For most ventures, when they are charged, the GC demands, receives, and records lien waivers from anyone on the job. This involves contractors, subcontractors, manufacturers of supplies, rental companies of equipment, and every other party to the building project (potential lien claimant). To the degree (the amount of money) set forth in the waiver, signing a waiver waives lien rights.The definition of lien; let us assume a supplier or subcontractor is not paid by the general contractor overseeing the project for the work or materials they provide. For the unpaid bill that is deposited with the county, a mechanic's lien is a legal claim. If a payment solution cannot be worked out in a timely manner, to get paid, the supplier or subcontractor may force the selling of the home at auction.The option would be to pay twice; once to the general contractor and then to the supplier or subcontractor a second time. Even if the lien is not enforced, merely having one attached to a property will cause a lot of problems for Nate when it is time to sell, because when a lien is still on the books, no bank can make a mortgage. A lien waiver is a documented arrangement made by that party to give up the right to put a lien on the property between a payer and another party.An example of a construction lien waiver in action is here: Subcontractor send to the general contractor pay application with conditional lien waiver A general contractor pays the $50K to a subcontractor and gives the subcontractor unconditional lien waiver to sign. By signing the waiver, the subcontractor then renounces $100k worth of lien rights.Everyone in the construction industry encounters lien waiver documents, but too often, these complex and consequential forms are overlooked. Whether you are a sole proprietor or a large corporation, understanding and managing construction lien waiver requests is important.We should consider that there are some statutory forms for lien waivers in 12 states in the United States of America will be discussed later in this research.",

    "paragraph4": "Lien Waivers safeguard everyone. The general contractor is shielded against the possibility of a mechanical lien in the above case, and the waiver prevents the subcontractor from non-payment. All parties to the lien waiver get what they earned, and the payment process is fair and clear when exchanging lien waivers works as expectedSince they can buy supplies and do substantial work for a client, contractors put themselves at risk and then must deal with a client who pays late or not at all. In certain jurisdictions, contractors, mechanics, and vendors are covered from non-payment by liens. They could be less likely to delay payment if consumers know that these companies will put liens on their propertyA lien waiver usually states that the party has paid in full and the supplier, contractor, or mechanic releases the client from all property liens and claims. For example, if a contractor repairs the cabinets of an individual, after the whole work is completed, he will take periodic payments or receive all of his payment. If the consumer refuses to pay him, due to the materials he has purchased as well as the labor he has done, he will incur a considerable loss, one recourse the contractor has to put a lien on the houseOnce all the money he owes to a supplier, contractor, or mechanic has been paid by a customer, he will request a signed lien waiver. This waiver effectively waives the signer's right to put a lien on the propertyof the consumer due to non-payment. If a customer may not obtain a signed lien waver, even if he has paid the hired party or supplier in full, he could be at risk of getting a lien put on the houseIn order to ensure that they are dealing with trustworthy companies and maintain all their payment records, a homeowner should always do their best. NEVER pay in cash for services unless you get a receipt and a lien waiver from the owner or the company's approved representative. In our sector, even though a homeowner has paid a contractor in full for services and materials, if the contractor may not pay the material bill, a supplier can still be able to file a lien against the houseBy applying for a lien waiver from the supplier as well as the contractor, you will shield yourself from this. In most situations, the supplier cannot file a lien until the goods are shipped to the job by the contractor, but if the supplier provides the materials, then they can.",
    "heading5": "Forms of waivers with lien: -",
    "paragraph5": "Conditional waiver on progress payment-The most reliable waiver for claimants, this waiver usually states that the waiver is an effective proof against any lien claim on the property if they have already been paid to date and that requires no return or stopped payment checks.Unconditional waiver on progress payment-This waiver unconditionally unlocks all applicant privileges at a particular date and requires no return or stopped payment checks.Conditional waiver on final payment- This waiver releases all claimant rights to file a mechanics lien if they have indeed been paid to date (and that includes no return or stopped payment check).Unconditional final waiver final payment - The best waiver for owners, this waiver normally releases all the claimant's rights to put a mechanics lien unconditionally on the property of the owner. If the payment check has been returned or the payment has ceased, it is immaterial. Only when they are sure their work is completed, and the payment has cleared their bank should claimants grant this form of release. When they are paid in full, owners should claim this release. On final payment, some states authorize an Unconditional Release that is used to facilitate the final payment.",

    "img4": "/blogs/blog5content3.png",
    "paragraph7": "Any construction trade partners furnishing a building project with materials, labor, or services may be entitled to file a mechanics' lien or bond claim if they are not compensated. But at the same time, those in charge or at the top of a project, such as the land owner, lender, building manager, or general contractor, are highly motivated to successfully complete the project without the filing of any liens or bond claims. And that is when it comes to waivers.Waivers act as a form of 'proof of payment.' There is a payor (the paying party) and a payee (the party receiving payment) any time a payment is made on a building project. The payee will execute (sign) a lien waiver accepting receipt of the payment when lien waivers are involved and agreeing not to file a lien with respect to the same number.The payor (typically, the GC) will receive and control all the lien waivers on the job from the subs and suppliers and send them to the owner of the house.Everyone should walk away happy when this scheme works as it should: the payee gets paid the money they won, and the paying party gets the guarantee that there will be no filing of a mechanics lien. Sending lien exemptions will, for these reasons, potentially help you get paid faster.Not unexpectedly, it is also very haphazard to use the terms used by the industry to identify a lien cancellation. 'You can also hear, and many others, 'lien elimination' or 'lien release. All in all, this issue can have serious implications with ambiguous terms, so be specific about which document you are referring to!",
    "heading8": "The difference between Lien Waivers and No Lien Clauses:",
    "paragraph8": "The naming mystery does not stop there, sadly. In the field of building payments, another contradictory term is no lien clauses.' No lien clauses are provisions that are included in the project contract that a party agrees to waive all potential lien claims. No lien clauses are sometimes called 'no lien agreements'.Because the contract is usually signed before the work actually starts at the very beginning of a project, this ensures that before any payment is due and/or before any furnishing, a no lien clause' comes into play. Learn all on why it is a poor idea to waive your lien rights prior to a project.A no lien clause varies from a waiver of a lien. After the work has been done, a waiver arrives and is only signed by the parties after a payment is due, in which the party waives the right to file a lien on the work being paid for.No lien clauses are very controversial, unlike the lien waiver text. In fact, in only 2 states, they are only formally permitted. The legislatures in over 20 states specifically outlaw no lien clauses.No Lien Clauses: 50-Construction Industry Summary for the State 12 States have mandatory forms of lien waiver, but the majority do not.",
    "paragraph9": "Only 12 states have statutory requirements for lien waiver forms, which are highlighted on this color- coded map, below.",

    "paragraph10": "Florida does not mandate the use of the statutory lien waiver by the parties but provides the waiver as a protected choice and tends to preclude the requirement of a non-statutory form by the parties. If you furnish supplies, labor, or services to one of the 12 'controlled states, it is a little simpler to deal with lien waivers.If the time for signing a lien waiver is correct, you simply serve up and request the statutory form. There is no space for discussion regarding the nature of the lien waiver document since all non-statutory lien waiver forms are usually made as absolutely null and void by state legislatures.There are three states where lien exemptions must be notarized: Texas, Wyoming, and Mississippi. When operating in one of these three states on a building project, notarization is considered true and enforceable in order for a lien waiver to be considered.",
    "heading9": "Waiving Contractual Rights",
    "paragraph11": "There are several activities involved in starting up a new construction work. There's the RFP, the method of calculating, submitting the bid, and so on. If your company is selected to work on the job, you will typically sign a contract at some stage before the work starts. Many of your agreed-upon obligations (what you have to do and all of your agreed-upon 'powers' as spelled out in the contract (what you get) will be spelled out by that contract.The risk here is that your building contract states that you are allowed a certain right with respect to lien waivers, but then you sign a lien waiver that contains wording indicating that you are 'waiving' or giving up that right.",
    "heading10": "Case Study",
    "paragraph12": "here is a notorious case from Texas involving a company named Zachry Construction that highlights the danger here (View the Contractor Profile of Zachry Construction showing how subcontractors are paid and treated). In that situation, because the exemptions they signed prevented them from protecting themselves against liquidated damages, Zachry ended up losing over $2 million.Take a moment to think about how terrifying this situation can be: Zachry Construction did work for it and was owed cash. They were forced to sign lien waivers to obtain a payout. The exchange of lien waiver for payment is entirely fair, and for both parties to do a rational and conventional thing.However, apart from the exchanged payment (i.e. liquidated damages), the parties still had certain objects they contested. Zachry was totally disarmed by the lien waiver text, which really had nothing to do with the conflict, since it had clauses within it waiving the right to claim any defenses. So, Personal Attestations Creating Personal Liability.The lien waivers they signed, sadly for Zachry, had clauses that waived much more than lien rights, and ended up costing them millions of dollars. Bottom line: Be aware that any additional wording that allows you to give up contractual rights does not include the waivers you sign to get paid!Another thing we have seen in lien waivers is a provision to 'personally attest' to the contents of the waiver by the person signing the waiver.At first glance, this personal attestation provision may seem innocuous, but in fact it creates potential personal responsibility for a construction contract that otherwise probably does not have any personal liability.A subcontractor or an employee at the office of the subcontractor would obviously want to avoid this risk. The interests of owners against the rights of future lien applicants are continually weighed by state governments and courts, and the entire point of the lien waiver is to protect third parties against uncertain liens.If the third party does its job of collecting the lien exemptions, then in the event of the waivers being incorrect by no fault of their own, the courts and laws must cover them. That is, in large part, exactly what is happening.Hence, what the waiver says you have received is often more important when you sign a lien waiver than what you have actually received.",
    "heading11": "In Conclusion,",
    "paragraph13": "Be very carful if you have been asking to sign any lien waiver, know the difference between them because if you sign for example unconditional Lien waiver if you did not receive the check, that will take your rights in claims, liens.",

    "intro": "When working on federal and Department of Transportation (DOT) projects, contractors must adhere to specific rules and regulations designed to protect workers and ensure fair wages. One critical requirement is certified payroll reporting, which ensures compliance with federal wage and labor laws. Whether you are a contractor, subcontractor, or involved in public infrastructure projects, understanding certified payroll is crucial to maintaining compliance and avoiding penalties. In this article, we'll explore what certified payroll is, why it's required, how to submit it, and the specific details regarding federal and DOT projects.",

    "heading1": "What is Certified Payroll?",
    "paragraph1": "Certified payroll is a reporting process that contractors and subcontractors must follow when working on federally funded construction projects. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in 1931, is the primary law that mandates contractors to pay their workers at least the prevailing wage rates set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for public works projects. These wage rates vary based on location and type of work performed. The certified payroll report is a weekly submission that includes details about each employee's wages and hours worked, ensuring that the correct wages are paid according to the prevailing wage schedule. The contractor must sign and certify that the information provided is accurate and that wages have been properly distributed.",

    "heading2": "Why is Certified Payroll Required?",
    "paragraph2": "Certified payroll reporting serves multiple purposes: it ensures worker protection by guaranteeing fair wages according to local prevailing wage rates, enforces compliance with federal labor laws such as the Davis-Bacon Act and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA), and helps ensure government accountability by preventing wage theft, fraud, and worker exploitation.",

    "title": "Understanding the Schedule of Values in Construction",
    "intro": "The Schedule of Values (SOV) is a fundamental financial tool in the construction industry, widely used to manage and track project budgets throughout the construction process. It serves as a detailed document that breaks down the overall contract sum into individual, manageable portions of work. This allows contractors, project owners, and stakeholders to have a clear, itemized view of the cost allocation and payment schedule throughout the project lifecycle.",

    "heading1": "What is a Schedule of Values (SOV)?",
    "paragraph1": "The Schedule of Values is essentially a project-specific breakdown of all the work that needs to be completed, along with the corresponding costs for each task. It lists every component of the project in a sequential order, typically from initial groundwork to final touches. Each line item on the SOV corresponds to a specific part of the construction work, and the costs assigned to each item represent a percentage of the total contract amount. The SOV is typically created by the general contractor (or construction manager) and submitted to the project owner for approval at the beginning of the project. For example, on a building project, the SOV might include line items for excavation, foundation work, framing, roofing, electrical, plumbing, and interior finishes, each with a defined dollar amount allocated to it.",

    "heading2": "Why is a Schedule of Values Important?",
    "paragraph2": "The primary function of the Schedule of Values is to serve as a basis for invoicing and payment requests. As work progresses, contractors submit payment applications (also known as progress billing), referencing the SOV to show the percentage of work completed and the corresponding amount of payment they are entitled to. This system ensures that payments are made only for work that has been completed and approved, helping to maintain cash flow and avoid disputes over payments.",
    "importancePoints": [
      "Transparency: An SOV provides transparency for all parties involved in the project. The project owner or financial stakeholders can see exactly how much is being spent on each portion of the project, ensuring that the work is progressing within budget. This level of detail also prevents lump sum billing, where a contractor might bill large, unspecified amounts without clarification on the progress of specific tasks.",
      "Tracking Project Progress: The SOV is also a key tool for tracking the progress of construction. By tying payments to specific completed work, it helps project managers monitor how far along the project is relative to the project timeline and budget. Any delays or deviations from the planned schedule can be quickly identified and addressed.",
      "Change Order Management: Construction projects frequently involve changes in scope, and the SOV can easily be adjusted to reflect these changes. When a change order is issued, the SOV is updated with new line items or adjustments to existing costs. This ensures that any additional work or budget adjustments are accounted for and properly documented."
    ],

    "heading3": "How to Create a Schedule of Values",
    "paragraph3": "Creating a well-structured SOV involves several key steps:",
    "steps": [
      "Breaking Down the Project: The contractor must break the project down into its various components. These components could be phases of the work (e.g., demolition, structural work, mechanical systems, etc.) or specific work items (e.g., plumbing fixtures, electrical systems, etc.).",
      "Assigning Costs: Once the work is broken down, costs need to be assigned to each task. These costs should be based on the actual expenses required to complete each portion of the work, including labor, materials, overhead, and any profit margin. The total of all line items should match the total contract price agreed upon by the owner and contractor.",
      "Approval by the Owner: After the contractor prepares the SOV, it’s submitted to the project owner (and sometimes an architect or construction manager) for review and approval. If the owner has any concerns or questions about specific line items, these should be addressed and resolved before work begins.",
      "Regular Updates: The SOV is not a static document. It’s updated as the project progresses, reflecting completed work and any adjustments due to change orders or unexpected costs."
    ],
    "heading4": "Key Elements of a Schedule of Values",
    "paragraph4": "A typical SOV includes several essential components:",
    "elements": [
      "Line Item Number: A reference number for each work component.",
      "Description of Work: A brief description of the specific task or work area.",
      "Total Cost: The total dollar amount assigned to that task.",
      "Percentage Complete: As the project progresses, this shows how much of each task has been completed.",
      "Previous Payments: Reflects the amount paid to date for the work completed.",
      "Current Payment Due: The amount being requested for payment based on the current progress of the work."
    ],
    "heading5": "Common Challenges with SOV",
    "paragraph5": "While the SOV is an essential tool, it does come with challenges:",
    "challenges": [
      "Over/Under Billing: Contractors sometimes face the challenge of overbilling or underbilling. Overbilling occurs when a contractor bills for more work than is completed, which can create future cash flow issues. Underbilling, on the other hand, may leave the contractor with less cash than needed to cover costs, putting pressure on resources.",
      "Disputes Over Completed Work: If there is disagreement between the contractor and owner about the percentage of work completed, this can lead to disputes and delays in payments. Clear communication and regular site inspections can help alleviate these issues.",
      "Accuracy of Cost Allocation: Accurately assigning costs to each line item can be complex, especially in large projects with multiple subcontractors and trades. It’s essential to ensure that each cost is reflective of actual expenses and not artificially inflated or understated."
    ],
    "heading6": "Conclusion",
    "paragraph6": "The Schedule of Values is a vital document for managing the financial aspect of any construction project. It provides a clear roadmap for payments, ensures transparency, and helps track project progress. By breaking down the overall project cost into detailed tasks, the SOV serves as a foundational tool that keeps the project on budget and on track. Properly managing and updating the SOV throughout the project ensures that both contractors and project owners remain aligned financially and operationally, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the project."

    "intro": "In the fast-paced and complex world of construction, claims are an unavoidable reality. These claims usually arise when one party involved in a construction project perceives that there has been a failure to meet contract terms or that unexpected events have caused delays, disruptions, or additional costs. Effectively handling construction claims can mean the difference between a smooth project and one that spirals into costly disputes and litigation. Understanding how construction claims work, and knowing how to respond, can help contractors, project owners, and stakeholders manage risks, maintain good relationships, and keep projects on track.",
    "heading1": "What Are Construction Claims?",
    "paragraph1": "Construction claims generally fall into two main categories: claims for time and claims for money.",
    "heading2": "Claims for Time (Extension of Time - EOT Claims)",
    "paragraph2": "These occur when unforeseen circumstances delay a project’s progress. The contractor may claim additional time to complete the project without incurring penalties for late completion. Causes for these delays include bad weather, changes to the project scope, late approvals from the owner, or other factors outside the contractor’s control.",
    "heading3": "Claims for Money (Cost Claims)",
    "paragraph3": "These claims arise when a contractor believes they are entitled to additional compensation due to extra work, changes in scope, or unexpected costs during construction. These claims often stem from variations in the contract, unforeseen site conditions, or delays caused by the owner.",

    "heading4": "Common Causes of Construction Claims",
    "paragraph4": "Common causes include:",
    "causes": [
      "Scope Changes: When the owner makes changes to the original design or adds new features, it often leads to additional work, resulting in claims.",
      "Delays: If the contractor is delayed by events beyond their control, they may submit a claim for an extension of time or compensation for additional costs incurred.",
      "Design Errors: If the project’s design contains flaws or requires revision, it may cause delays and additional expenses, triggering claims.",
      "Disruptions: Events such as late delivery of materials, labor shortages, or interference from other contractors can cause disruptions that lead to claims for compensation or extra time.",

      "Review the Contract: The first thing to do when a claim is presented is to thoroughly review the contract. Contracts often contain provisions that outline how claims should be managed, including notice requirements, timelines, and specific dispute resolution processes.",
      "Investigate the Claim Thoroughly: Conduct an in-depth investigation into the facts surrounding the claim. This includes reviewing project documentation, such as daily logs, schedules, correspondence, and any other relevant records. For time-related claims, examine the project schedule and look for any delays or disruptions that could have impacted the timeline. For cost-related claims, check the original scope of work and any approved change orders to understand the basis of the claim.",
      "Assess the Merits of the Claim: Once all the facts have been gathered, assess whether the claim is valid under the contract terms. Does the contractor have a legitimate reason for additional time or costs? Are there provisions in the contract that allow for the adjustments being claimed?",
      "Negotiate in Good Faith: If the claim appears to be valid, engage in negotiations to find a fair resolution. Collaboration and open communication can often resolve claims before they escalate into formal disputes. Consider mediation or other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to settle the claim amicably.",
      "Maintain Thorough Documentation: One of the most important defenses against claims is keeping detailed and accurate records throughout the project. Every decision, approval, change, or delay should be documented to provide a clear paper trail.",
      "Seek Legal Advice When Necessary: If the claim cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, it may be necessary to seek legal counsel. A lawyer with experience in construction law can help assess the validity of the claim, protect your interests, and guide you through the process of formal dispute resolution."
